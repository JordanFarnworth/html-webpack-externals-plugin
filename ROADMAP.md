# v3.0.0 Roadmap

* [ ] Support CDNs in addition to copying local modules to the build
* [ ] Support ways to manually specify asset type (e.g. for when URLs don't end in `.css` or `.js`) -- may be dependent on html-webpack-include-assets-plugin
* [ ] Allow more flexibility in how files are copied to the public output via copy-webpack-plugin
* [x] Allow overriding of output `publicPath`
* [ ] Support specifying which HTML files are affected by the plugin in the case of multiple instances of html-webpack-plugin
